      # NOTE 2026-02-19: Advisories 1113296 (minimatch) and 1113214 (ajv) have no
      # available fix in npm yet — patched versions (minimatch@10.2.1, ajv@8.18.0)
      # are not yet released. All 19 HIGH vulns stem from these two advisories in
      # devDependencies (eslint, typescript-eslint, sentry) and exceljs/archiver.
      # Reverted to --audit-level=critical to still fail on any truly critical issues
      # while not blocking PRs on HIGH advisories with no available fix.
      # TODO: Change back to --audit-level=high once minimatch@10.2.1 is released.
